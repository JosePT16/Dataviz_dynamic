## Dynamic of democracy
Jose Pajuelo



## Goal

My goal is to develop a narrative that shows the dynamic of democracy in 2 aspects:
- The relationship with growth (developed in static project)
- And the dynamic that explain its adoptions related with inequality, 

## Data Challenges

- There not major concerncs about the data.
- I will explore working other measures of inequality or democracy that could enrich the analysis

## Walk Through


The map interaction shows whether a country is a democracy or not.
According to the year, we can see different dynamics in democratization and non-democratization waves. For example:

- In the 60s until mid-70s we can see a backslide in democracies in Latin America.
- In the 80s it shows a democratization wave also in Latin America that consolidates during the years.
- Starting in the middle of the 80s there is another wave of democratization in Africa that lasts until the 90s.
- It is also visible the democratization of the ex-Soviet and related countries since the 90s.


## Questions

I am planning to publish this work as a continuation of my static project. My goal is to prioritize the narrative and use the visualizations mainly as support for the story (in an article-style format). In this sense, I wanted to ask:

1. Would it be acceptable to submit an improved version of this draft, combined with the graphic and narrative from my first project in a web article-format, as my final project?

2. If that is possible, would this format reduce my chances of receiving an S on the final project? Or would you recommend that I focus instead on adding more features to these visualizations and presenting them as a separate, fully interactive, standalone project?
