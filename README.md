# Democracy Paradox – Interactive Data Visualization Project
This project is a web article inspired by the work of James Robinson and Daron Acemoglu. Following their arguments, it explores how democracy can foster economic growth and examines its dynamics and trends across the world through a combination of static visualizations, interactive charts, and animated regional maps.

It is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and D3 and is deployed via GitHub Pages:

## Overview

The web article features:

- Animated regional maps (Latin America, Africa) visualizing democratic scores over time

- Interactive charts using D3.js

- Static figures for contextual storytelling

- Smooth transitions and visual encoding designed for clarity and interpretability

- The overall goal is to communicate complex political-science data in a clear, intuitive, and visually engaging way.

## Tools used:
D3.js — core library for all maps, animations, and interactive charts

HTML5 — structure of the web article

CSS3 — styling, layout, and typography

GeoJSON — regional maps for spatial visualization

CSV datasets — democratic scores, repression indicators, etc.

GitHub Pages — hosting and deployment
